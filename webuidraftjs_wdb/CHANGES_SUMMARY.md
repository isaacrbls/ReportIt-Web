## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Rejection Counter (`rejectedReportCount`)
- Automatically increments when a report is rejected
- Stored in Firebase Realtime Database
- Visible in user details dialog
- Resets to 0 only when user is suspended
- Stays at 3 if admin declines suspension (serves as warning)

### Auto-Suspension Modal
- Triggers when user reaches 3 rejected reports
- Provides admin with two options:
  1. **Suspend User** - 2 weeks suspension + reset counter to 0
  2. **Don't Suspend** - Keep counter at 3, no suspension
- Shows user email and rejection count
- Clear UI with actionable buttons

### User Statistics Enhancement
User details now display:
- Total Reports
- Verified Reports
- Pending Reports
- **Rejected Reports** (NEW)
- Total Suspensions
- **Current Rejection Count** (NEW)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Functions in `reportUtils.js`:
```javascript
incrementUserRejectionCount(userEmail)  // Auto-increments counter
getUserRejectionCount(userEmail)         // Gets current count
resetUserRejectionCount(userEmail)       // Resets to 0
```

### New State in ReportsPageClient:
```javascript
const [showSuspensionModal, setShowSuspensionModal] = useState(false);
const [pendingSuspensionUser, setPendingSuspensionUser] = useState(null);
```

### New Handlers:
```javascript
handleSuspendUser()       // Suspends user for 2 weeks, resets counter
handleCancelSuspension()  // Keeps counter at 3, no suspension
```

## 📊 Database Schema Update

### Users (Realtime Database)
Added fields:
- `rejectedReportCount: number` - Current rejection count (0-3)
- `suspensionCount: number` - Total times suspended

## 🎨 UI Components Added

### Suspension Modal
- Title: "User Reached 3 Rejected Reports"
- Description with user email and count
- Two action buttons with clear labels
- Note explaining counter reset behavior

### Statistics Cards (User Details)
- New "Rejected Reports" card (red)
- New "Current Rejection Count" card (purple)

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Report Rejection**
   - Admin rejects report → Counter increments
   - System checks if count = 3
   - If yes, show modal

2. **Admin Decision**
   - **Option 1**: Suspend → User suspended 2 weeks, counter reset to 0
   - **Option 2**: Don't suspend → Counter stays at 3, no suspension

3. **Counter Reset**
   - Happens automatically only when user is suspended
   - Does NOT reset if admin declines suspension

## ✨ Benefits

- ✅ Automated tracking - no manual counting
- ✅ Admin has final say - not fully automatic
- ✅ Persistent warning - counter stays at 3 as a flag
- ✅ Transparent - visible in user details
- ✅ Fair - clear 3-rejection threshold
- ✅ Clean code - no errors or warnings

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

To test the feature:
- [ ] Create test user
- [ ] Submit 3 reports from that user
- [ ] Reject 1st report → check counter = 1
- [ ] Reject 2nd report → check counter = 2
- [ ] Reject 3rd report → modal should appear
- [ ] Test "Yes, Suspend User" → user suspended, counter = 0
- [ ] Test "No, Don't Suspend" → counter stays at 3, not suspended
- [ ] Check user details shows correct counts
- [ ] Verify modal appears again if user still has count = 3

## 📝 Documentation Created

1. **REJECTION_TRACKING_README.md** - Complete feature guide
2. **Updated USER_MANAGEMENT_README.md** - Added new fields and features

## 🚀 Ready to Use
